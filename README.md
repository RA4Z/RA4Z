## Hello, world! 👋 I'm Robert Aron Zimmermann 👨‍💻

At 20, I'm already diving headfirst into the world of software development 🌎. Currently, I'm navigating the challenges of ***PPC*** at ***WEG Energy*** ⚡️, working as a true code sailor ⚓️, both in requirements analysis and fullstack development.

### My toolbox is packed with powerful languages 💪:

- ***Python 🐍:*** My faithful companion for data analysis, powerful scripts, and task automation. From basic to advanced, I master its charms! ✨

- ***Typescript & Javascript 💻:*** The unbeatable duo for creating interactive and dynamic web interfaces. With them, I bring projects to life and enchant users!

- ***Java ☕:*** Robust and reliable, the ideal language for building scalable, high-performance applications.

- ***Go 🚀:*** My bet for the future! Concurrency and speed are its hallmarks, and I love exploring its possibilities.

- ***VBA 📊:*** The spreadsheet wizard! I master its secrets to automate processes and transform data into valuable insights.

### But I don't stop there! 🚀

I am a ***Power Query*** specialist, getting the most out of ***Excel*** and ***Power BI*** to transform raw data into strategic information. 📊

And when it comes to ***SAP***, I dominate ***SAP Scripting*** like no other, whether with Python or VBA. 🧙‍♂️

My thirst for knowledge drives me to explore new horizons, such as the world of ***MySQL*** and ***NoSQL*** databases, including ***Google Firebase*** and ***Supabase Database***. 🗄️

I believe in the power of ***Artificial Intelligence*** and I am dedicated to mastering the best Prompt ***Engineering techniques***, building intelligent ***Analysis Tools*** and ***Chatbots***. 🤖

My passion for technology drives me to every new challenge! 🚀
